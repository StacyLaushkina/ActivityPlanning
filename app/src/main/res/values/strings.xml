        Welcome to the draft version of Activity monitoring app!\n\n
        The application is aimed at the inefficiency of daily work and helps to plan, track and analyze working hours.\n
        Therefore, there are 3 main screens: plan, track and dashboard.\n\n

        Managers are supposed to use the plan screen to fill out what percentage they expect their employees to spend on tasks.\n\n
        Workers are supposed to use the track screen to measure how much time they spend on tasks.\n\n
        The idea is that the worker can track how much time he actually spent on the task and how much manager expected.
        Thus, at the end of the working day, the worker finishes the work by clicking on the “Finish” button
        and sees an encouraging success message or advice to be more effective in some types of tasks.\n\n
        The dashboard screen is for both the manager and the employee: it is important to see the trends, the difference between the plan and reality for both of them.\n
